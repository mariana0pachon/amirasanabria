(Merriam-Webster)\n\nIn Colombia, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico, un "cuero" (hide) is an old and leathery-skinned woman. A hardened and mature woman who has thick skin, a skin made out of hide and callus. A woman hard to chew up, a woman made from strong leather.\n\nThis one is for the women raised with thick skin , to the women who carry their hide with pride, to the women who save my skin.';
